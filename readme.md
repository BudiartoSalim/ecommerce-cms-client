# ecommerce-cms-client
App is deployed at: https://ecom-cms-client.web.app/

Content Management System Client for an ecommerce portfolio project. This app is made for ecommerce site admin to add, update, or remove items from the ecommerce site, therefore only user with "admin" role can access its contents and functionalities. Admin account cannot be made without seeding directly on server side, to try the site, use the seeded account down below for demo.

# DEMO ACCOUNT TO TEST THE APP
Use this seeded account -> email: admin@mail.com || password: 1234

This app is 1 of 3 parts of "ecommerce portfolio" project, the other project repos are:
- https://github.com/BudiartoSalim/ecommerce-customer
- https://github.com/BudiartoSalim/ecommerce-server

Any contents added in the CMS via the admin account above should be displayed on the Customer client hosted separately. You can use the admin account to access the customer client as well or register a new account to check.

First load might take a while since it's on free hosting site.
